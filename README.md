<h1>Summary</h1>

After completing a Udemy course (RPG Core Combat Creator: Learn Intermediate Unity C# Coding) I decided to develop my own version of the game that was created in the course. This project includes programming/editor techniques that I learned from the course as well as assets purchased from the Unity Asset Store (https://assetstore.unity.com/).

<br>

I learned how to:
- Import Unity Assets from the Asset Store and configure them for my project
- Structure project folders and hierarchy in a clean and organized manner
- Set up character animations for movement, fighting, and dancing
- Structure a code base and manage dependencies using C# namespaces
- Use scriptable objects to make the creation of in game items easy for designers (weapon system)
- Create and decorate level terrain from scratch
- Implement raycasting for movement and combat
- Configure a navmesh for player and enemy movement
- Program enemy AI behaviors such as attacking, patrolling, group aggro, etc.
- Develop a stats system that is configurable and easy to use for game designers (changes made in editor, not code!)
- Create different enemy types that each have unique weapons
- Create various UI components for player HUD (health bar, honor bar, weapon selection)
- Implement instantiation of projectiles for throwing weapons like the shuriken
- Create particle effects and trails for weapons/pickups
- Create pickups that restore the player's health
- Implement random drop chance for items after killing an enemy (health pickups)
- Implement random direction for weapon hit effects (blood spray)
- Implement background music playlist with random shuffle
