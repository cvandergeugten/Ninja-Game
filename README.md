<h1>Summary</h1>

After completing a Udemy course (RPG Core Combat Creator: Learn Intermediate Unity C# Coding) I decided to develop my own version of the game that was created in the course. This project includes programming/editor techniques that I learned from the course as well as assets purchased from the Unity Asset Store (https://assetstore.unity.com/).

<br>

I learned how to:
- Import Unity Assets from the Asset Store and configure them for my project
- Structure project folders and hierarchy in a clean and organized manner
- Set up character animations for movement, fighting, and dancing
- Structure a code base and manage dependencies using C# namespaces
- Use scriptable objects to make the creation of in game items easy for designers (weapon system)
-
